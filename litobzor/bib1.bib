   abstract = {A detailed understanding of oxidation/dissolution mechanisms of Pt is critical in designing durable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), but exact mechanisms remain unclear. The present work explores the oxidation/dissolution of Pt and Pt monolayer (ML) electrocatalysts over a wide range of applied potentials using cells that facilitate in situ measurements by combining X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) measurement demonstrated that Pt nanoparticle surfaces were oxidized from metallic Pt to α-PtO2-type oxide during the potential sweep from 0.41 to 1.5 V, and the transition state of O or OH adsorption on Pt and the onset of the place exchange process were revealed by the delta mu (Δμ) method. Only the top layers of Pt nanoparticles were oxidized, while the inner Pt atoms remained intact. At a higher potential over 1.9 V, α-PtO2-type surface oxides dissolve due to local acidification caused by the oxygen evolution reaction and carbon corrosion. Pt oxidation of PtML on the Pd nanoparticle electrocatalyst is considerably hampered compared with the Pt/C catalyst, presumably because preferential Pd oxidation proceeds at the defects in Pt MLs up to 0.91 V and through O penetrated through the Pt MLs by the place exchange process above 1.11 V.},

   abstract = {The electrochemical oxidation behaviors of the surfaces of platinum nanoparticles, one of the key phenomena in fuel cell developments, were investigated in situ and in real time, via time-resolved hard X-ray diffraction and energy dispersive X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Combining two complementary structural analyses, dynamical and inhomogenous structural changes occurring at the surfaces of nanoparticles were monitored on an atomic level with a time resolution of less than 1 s. After oxidation at 1.4 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution, longer Pt-O bonds (2.2-2.3 A that can be assigned to OHH and/or OH species) were first formed on the surface through the partial oxidation of water molecules. Next, these species turned to shorter Pt-0 bonds (2.0 Å, adsorbed atomic oxygen), and atomic oxygen was incorporated into the inner part of the nanoparticles, forming an initial monolayer oxide that had α-PtO 2-like local structures with expanded Pt-Pt bonds (3.1 Å). Finally, quasi-three-dimensional oxides with longer Pt-(O)-Pt bonds (3.5 A, precursor for β-PtO2) grew on the surface, at almost 100 s after oxidation. Despite the very complex oxidation mechanism on the atomic level, XANES analysis indicated that the charge transfer from platinum to the adsorbed oxygen species was almost constant and rather small, that is, about 0.5 electrons per oxygen, up to two monolayers of oxygen. This means that ionic polarization hardly develops at this stage of the surface platinum's "oxide" growth. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {The processes leading to degradation of Pt nanoparticles inside commercial hydrogen fuel cell catalyst layers are studied in situ, using time-resolved high-energy powder X-ray diffraction. Advances in electrochemical cell design significantly increase the quality of diffraction patterns obtained at practical catalyst loadings at high temporal resolution and allow the use of advanced techniques including differential pair distribution function analysis. Rietveld refinement of the lattice parameter and peak intensities during cyclic voltammetry or potential steps allow the separate steps of oxygen electroadsorption and place exchange in the Pt oxide growth mechanism to be clearly differentiated. The slow kinetics of the place-exchange process limit the oxide growth under standard laboratory conditions, decoupling the surface chemistry of the nanoparticles from the applied potential and directly affecting the outcome of accelerated stress tests measured with different cycling schemes. High-speed diffraction measurements are also used to follow the oxide reduction reaction, which is much faster. Refined structural parameters from these data show direct evidence for a transient, disordered platinum intermediate created during reduction of the oxide, which is likely responsible for catalyst dissolution when cycling to high potentials.},

We report on the different elements that are diffusing already during the sintering process as well as their evolution after long-term operation. In both type of cell, Co is the element that is highly segregating from the LSCF electrode during the electrochemical reaction. The CGO barrier does not prevent the diffusion of Sr in the electrolyte of the CSC cell while it does in the ESC cell. In addition, the contact layer between the hydrogen electrode and the electrolyte in the ESC cell seems to prevent the Ni depletion. A high concentration of gadolinium from the CGO layer is visible at the CGO/electrolyte interface on the oxygen electrode side as well as on the hydrogen electrode side in the ESC cell. The gadolinium concentration significantly increases during the cell operation to form a layer of a few micrometers.},

   abstract = {The structure of the Nafion ionomer used in proton-exchange membranes of H 2 /O 2 fuel cells has long been contentious. Using a recently introduced algorithm, we have quantitatively simulated previously published small-angle scattering data of hydrated Nafion. The characteristic ionomer peak arises from long parallel but otherwise randomly packed water channels surrounded by partially hydrophilic side branches, forming inverted-micelle cylinders. At 20 vol\% water, the water channels have diameters of between 1.8 and 3.5 nm, with an average of 2.4 nm. Nafion crystallites (10 vol\%), which form physical crosslinks that are crucial for the mechanical properties of Nafion films, are elongated and parallel to the water channels, with cross-sections of (5 nm) 2. Simulations for various other models of Nafion, including Gierkes cluster and the polymer-bundle model, do not match the scattering data. The new model can explain important features of Nafion, including fast diffusion of water and protons through Nafion and its persistence at lowtemperatures. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

   abstract = {Prognostics is a promising solution to the short lifetime and high-cost bottlenecks of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The advances of PEMFCs prognostics research can be divided into two main categories, namely, the innovations of prognostics methods and the innovations of degradation indexes. Among them, the degradation indexes are the prerequisites for accurate prognostics of PEMFCs. Although many prognostics methods have been proposed in recent years to improve the performance of prognostics, the research on degradation indexes of PEMFCs has been slow, and few studies have focused on more effective and more general degradation indexes. Currently, the most widely used degradation indexes are still the traditional indexes, which only reflect the macro-scale degradation of PEMFCs, such as voltage and power. In addition, the traditional indexes change as operating conditions change. For PEMFCs under dynamic operating conditions, especially in transportation applications, it is difficult to obtain accurate degradation information based on the traditional indexes. Due to the lack of more accurate, comprehensive, and general degradation indexes, the existing prognostics methods inevitably have limitations and deficiencies. The purpose of this paper is to provide a full review of the latest research advances in the prognostics of PEMFCs, especially the degradation indexes. Moreover, the challenges and future directions of prognostics research are also analyzed.},

   abstract = {Cost and durability remain the two major barriers to the widespread commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC)-based power systems, especially for the most impactful but challenging fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) application. Commercial FCEVs are now on the road; however, their PEMFC systems do not meet the cost targets established by the U.S. Department of Energy, primarily due to the high platinum loading needed on the cathode to achieve the requisite performance and lifetime. While the activities of a number of commercial Pt-based alloy cathode catalysts exceed the beginning-of-life (BOL) targets, these activities, and the overall cathode performance, degrade via a variety of mechanisms described herein. Degradation is mitigated in current FCEVs by utilizing a cathode catalyst with a lower BOL activity (e.g., much lower transition metal alloy content and larger BOL nanoparticle size), necessitating higher catalyst loadings, and through the utilization of system controls that avoid conditions known to exacerbate degradation processes, such as limiting the fuel cell stack voltage range. The design and development of active and robust materials and eliminating the need for vehicle mitigation strategies would greatly simplify the operating system, allowing for greater transient operation, avoiding large hybridization, and curtailing of fuel cell power. Although system mitigation strategies have provided the near-term pathway for FCEV commercialization, material-specific solutions are required to further reduce costs and improve operability and efficiency. Future material developments should focus on stabilization of the electrode structure and minimization of the catalyst particle susceptibility to dissolution caused by oxide formation and reduction over PEMFC cathode-relevant operating potentials plus minimization of support corrosion. Ex situ accelerated stress tests have provided insight into the processes responsible for material and performance degradation and will continue to provide useful information on the relative stability of materials and benchmarks for robust and stable materials-based solutions not requiring system mitigation strategies to achieve adequate lifetime.},

   abstract = {A bibliometric analysis of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) content from a total of 15.020 research publications was conducted between 2008 and 2018, the papers being detailed in the online version of SCI-Expanded, Thomson Reuters Web of Science. Data processing tools such as Hitscite, CiteSpace, ArcGIS and Ucinet 6 were used to process the information. The parameters analyzed in the analysis were: type of document; the language of publication; volume and characteristics of publication output; publication by journals; performance of countries and research institutions; research trends and visibility. The study showed that "Fuel", "Cell", "Membrane" and "Proton" were found in most of the titles of the documents, while "Performance", "Pemfc", "Pem Fuel Cell" and "Fuel Cell" were the keywords most commonly used in documents. The analysis found that PEMFC studies have tended to be growing and that leading peer-reviewed journals have produced numerous publications on the subject. The investigation revealed that the country with the most significant production in the field is USA with a contribution of 3009; 20\% of the total publications. Followed by China 2480; 16.5\%, South Korea 1273; 8.5\% and Germany 1121; 7.5\%, showing to the main world powers as the most significant contributors to the research.},

   abstract = {The cold start is one of the key research fields in proton exchange membrane fuel cell investigation. In this work, a low temperature durability and consistency analysis is performed on a 5-cells stack. After 20 times freezing and thaw cycles, coefficient of variation of individual cell voltage increase significantly. Through the polarization curve test, it is found that the output performance degradation of each individual cell is inconsistent. The No.1 cell which is the nearest from the gas inlets has the maximum performance degradation. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscope, segmented current density test and synchrotron radiation X-ray scan 3D image reconstruction, the cracks on the interface of membrane and catalyst layer are observed in situ successfully for the first time. Under the condition in this work, the water content of No.1 cell is the most, and a lot amount of water is frozen at the air inlet area. Due to the frost heave stress, the structure of membrane electrode assembly is damaged. This causes the loss and the agglomeration of catalyst, and even the delamination of catalyst layer. The above structure changes cause a decrease in catalyst activity and an increase in cell resistance, and eventually lead to the inconsistent degradation in output performance. The characterization results in this work are helpful for the optimization and application of membrane electrodes assembly and stacks for vehicle fuel cells.},

This cell allows for in situ elastic scattering measurements (WAXS, SAXS) during electrochemical operation with minimal trade-offs in cell performance vs benchtop designs, and is capable of reaching automotive current densities. A key feature is that the beam enters the cell at grazing incidence to the electrodes, massively increasing the effective pathlength and therefore the signal-to-background ratio.

   abstract = {How to improve durability of catalysts is the major challenge hindering the large-scale implementation of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). The alloy catalysts have been developed in efforts to reduce platinum loading, enhance catalysts activity and durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of PEMFCs. This manuscript reports the application of stepwise reduction synthesis to synthesize Pt–Ni/C and Pt–Ni–Ir/C catalysts. The synthesized electrocatalysts were characterized by X–ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results from CV and LSV showed that when as-prepared Pt–Ni–Ir nanocrystals are uniformly dispersed on the carbon support, the catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. When the atomic ratio of Pt, Ni, Ir is 2:2:1, after durability test of 5000 cycles, rotating disk electrode (RDE) demonstrated ORR activities of the as-prepared catalysts with the highest mass activity (MA) of 351mA⋅gPt−1 at 0.9ViR-free and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 80 m2⋅gPt−1, which is over 17 and 2 times than those of Pt/C JM (Johnson Matthey) catalyst, respectively. This work highlights the potential to use a preparative method which means step-by-step reduction synthesis to form ternary alloy catalysts for ORR of PEMFCs.},

The electrochemical surface area (ESA) loss of cathode electrocatalyst was investigated by electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, CV). During the first about 300 h, the ESA decreased fast from 17.2 to 7.8 m2 gPt- 1 (about 55\%), and had only a small decrease (about 5\%) in the following 210 h. The tested cathode catalysts were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the degree of electrocatalyst sintering. The results showed that the Pt particle size in the cathode increased from 4.0 to 8.3 nm before and after 300 h but it had no obvious growth in the further life tests. The tested MEA was also analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) to investigate the platinum deposition in H3PO4/PBI membrane. Platinum did not be found in the tested H3PO4/PBI membrane. Above results indicated that the agglomeration of Pt particle should be responsible for the ESA loss of Pt/C electrocatalyst. The further analyses on TEM data suggested that agglomeration of platinum particles occurred via coalescence mechanism on carbon at the nanometer scale. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The performance of H2/O2 proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) fed with CO-contaminated hydrogen was investigated for anodes with PdPt/C and PdPtRu/C electrocatalysts. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and "in situ" X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Experiments were conducted in electrochemical half and single cells by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and I-V polarization measurements, while DEMS was employed to verify the formation of CO2 at the PEMFC anode outlet. A quite high performance was achieved for the PEMFC fed with H2 + 100 ppm CO with the PdPt/C and PdPtRu/C anodes containing 0.4 mg metal cm-2, with the cell presenting potential losses below 200 mV at 1 A cm-2, with respect to the system fed with pure H2. For the PdPt/C catalysts no CO2 formation was seen at the PEMFC anode outlet, indicating that the CO tolerance is improved due to the existence of more free surface sites for H2 electrooxidation, probably due to a lower Pd-CO interaction compared to pure Pd or Pt. For PdPtRu/C the CO tolerance may also have a contribution from the bifunctional mechanism, as shown by the presence of CO2 in the PEMFC anode outlet. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Dynamic liquid water transport behavior in the cathode CL and GDL was observed at high spatial and temporal resolution (1 frame/s). At low current density, generation of liquid water was recognized under the rib, while at high current density, liquid water was observed both under the rib and the channel. Temporal behaviors of liquid water accumulation in GDL under the rib and discharge process of liquid water to under the channel were also visualized. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

   abstract = {In order to investigate the effect of the cracks on the MPL on liquid water transport, the cross-sectional imaging (cell membrane parallel to the beam) of liquid water behavior in the operating PEMFC was carried out by laboratory-based soft X-ray radiography technique. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the visualization were 0.5 um and 2 s/frame, respectively. The carbon cloth GDLs with the cracked MPL were used and each layer of the PEMFC and the crack on the MPL were clearly visualized. The results clearly showed that the liquid water mainly flows through the crack on the MPL to the substrate layer, and no liquid water was observed in the MPL. Because the MPL is highly hydrophobic, the MPL can limit the liquid water access to the substrate layer. On the other hand, liquid water tends to be stored in the interface between the CL and the MPL. These results suggest that the larger pores (e.g. cracks) on the MPL function as the liquid water pathway to the substrate layer, and the smaller pores on the MPL function as the gas transport path, and the surface morphology of the MPL might affect the liquid water transport in the PEMFC. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Through-plane images under various operating conditions combined with PEMFC performance revealed that, under wet conditions, the MPL was associated with an increased number of breakthrough locations, resulting in higher operating potentials. With these results, it is suggested that the MPL prevents liquid water from agglomerating into larger clusters at the catalyst layer/MPL interface, thereby reducing the number of blocked pathways for oxygen transport. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is a high-performance electrochemical device for energy conversion. A single cell is composed of five layers made of different ceramic materials: anode support, anode functional layer, electrolyte, cathode functional layer and cathode. The mechanical integrity of the cell is a major issue during its lifetime, especially for the electrolyte layer. Damage of the cells is mainly due to the high operating temperature, the "redox" behaviour of the anode and the brittleness of the involved materials. Since residual stresses are known to play a significant role in the damage evolution, it is important to determine them. For this purpose, residual stresses in an anode-supported planar SOFC were measured by X-ray diffraction. Firstly, macroscopic stresses in each phase of each layer were studied using the sin2ψ method on a laboratory X-ray goniometer at room temperature. This technique enables the calculation of residual stress of the material from the measurement of the crystal lattice deformation. The electrolyte has been found under bi-axial compressive stress of -920 MPa. Secondly, X-ray measurements controlling depth penetration were made in the electrolyte using grazing incidence method. The results show that the stress is not homogenous in the layer. The first five micrometers of the electrolyte have been found less constrained (-750 MPa) than the complete layer, suggesting a gradient of deformation in the electrolyte from the interface with the Anode Functional Layer to the free surface. Finally, local stress measurements were made on the electrolyte layer by X-ray synchrotron radiation that allows high accuracy measurement on the (sub-) micrometer scale. Polychromatic and monochromatic beams are used to determine the complete strain tensor from grain to grain in the electrolyte. First results confirm the macroscopic stress trend of the electrolyte. These X-ray techniques at different scales will contribute to a better understanding of the residual stress in the electrolyte layer and thus to the involved damage mechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.
