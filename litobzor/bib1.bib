In this work, a low temperature durability and consistency analysis is performed on a 5-cells stack. After 20 times freezing and thaw cycles, coefficient of variation of individual cell voltage increase significantly. Through the polarization curve test, it is found that the output performance degradation of each individual cell is inconsistent. The No.1 cell which is the nearest from the gas inlets has the maximum performance degradation. Through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron microscope, segmented current density test and synchrotron radiation X-ray scan 3D image reconstruction, the cracks on the interface of membrane and catalyst layer are observed in situ successfully for the first time. Under the condition in this work, the water content of No.1 cell is the most, and a lot amount of water is frozen at the air inlet area. Due to the frost heave stress, the structure of membrane electrode assembly is damaged. This causes the loss and the agglomeration of catalyst, and even the delamination of catalyst layer. The above structure changes cause a decrease in catalyst activity and an increase in cell resistance, and eventually lead to the inconsistent degradation in output performance. The characterization results in this work are helpful for the optimization and application of membrane electrodes assembly and stacks for vehicle fuel cells.},

The alloy catalysts have been developed in efforts to reduce platinum loading, enhance catalysts activity and durability for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) of PEMFCs. This manuscript reports the application of stepwise reduction synthesis to synthesize Pt–Ni/C and Pt–Ni–Ir/C catalysts. The synthesized electrocatalysts were characterized by X–ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), cyclic voltammetry (CV) and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV). The results from CV and LSV showed that when as-prepared Pt–Ni–Ir nanocrystals are uniformly dispersed on the carbon support, the catalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability. When the atomic ratio of Pt, Ni, Ir is 2:2:1, after durability test of 5000 cycles, rotating disk electrode (RDE) demonstrated ORR activities of the as-prepared catalysts with the highest mass activity (MA) of 351mA⋅gPt−1 at 0.9ViR-free and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of 80 m2⋅gPt−1, which is over 17 and 2 times than those of Pt/C JM (Johnson Matthey) catalyst, respectively.

The electrochemical surface area (ESA) loss of cathode electrocatalyst was investigated by electrochemical techniques (cyclic voltammetry, CV). During the first about 300 h, the ESA decreased fast from 17.2 to 7.8 m2 gPt- 1 (about 55\%), and had only a small decrease (about 5\%) in the following 210 h. The tested cathode catalysts were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the degree of electrocatalyst sintering. The results showed that the Pt particle size in the cathode increased from 4.0 to 8.3 nm before and after 300 h but it had no obvious growth in the further life tests. The tested MEA was also analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) to investigate the platinum deposition in H3PO4/PBI membrane. Platinum did not be found in the tested H3PO4/PBI membrane. Above results indicated that the agglomeration of Pt particle should be responsible for the ESA loss of Pt/C electrocatalyst. The further analyses on TEM data suggested that agglomeration of platinum particles occurred via coalescence mechanism on carbon at the nanometer scale. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and "in situ" X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Experiments were conducted in electrochemical half and single cells by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and I-V polarization measurements, while DEMS was employed to verify the formation of CO2 at the PEMFC anode outlet. A quite high performance was achieved for the PEMFC fed with H2 + 100 ppm CO with the PdPt/C and PdPtRu/C anodes containing 0.4 mg metal cm-2, with the cell presenting potential losses below 200 mV at 1 A cm-2, with respect to the system fed with pure H2. For the PdPt/C catalysts no CO2 formation was seen at the PEMFC anode outlet, indicating that the CO tolerance is improved due to the existence of more free surface sites for H2 electrooxidation, probably due to a lower Pd-CO interaction compared to pure Pd or Pt. For PdPtRu/C the CO tolerance may also have a contribution from the bifunctional mechanism, as shown by the presence of CO2 in the PEMFC anode outlet. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Dynamic liquid water transport behavior in the cathode CL and GDL was observed at high spatial and temporal resolution (1 frame/s).

   abstract = {In order to investigate the effect of the cracks on the MPL on liquid water transport, the cross-sectional imaging (cell membrane parallel to the beam) of liquid water behavior in the operating PEMFC was carried out by laboratory-based soft X-ray radiography technique. The spatial and temporal resolutions of the visualization were 0.5 um and 2 s/frame, respectively. The carbon cloth GDLs with the cracked MPL were used and each layer of the PEMFC and the crack on the MPL were clearly visualized. The results clearly showed that the liquid water mainly flows through the crack on the MPL to the substrate layer, and no liquid water was observed in the MPL. Because the MPL is highly hydrophobic, the MPL can limit the liquid water access to the substrate layer. On the other hand, liquid water tends to be stored in the interface between the CL and the MPL. These results suggest that the larger pores (e.g. cracks) on the MPL function as the liquid water pathway to the substrate layer, and the smaller pores on the MPL function as the gas transport path, and the surface morphology of the MPL might affect the liquid water transport in the PEMFC. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is a high-performance electrochemical device for energy conversion. A single cell is composed of five layers made of different ceramic materials: anode support, anode functional layer, electrolyte, cathode functional layer and cathode. The mechanical integrity of the cell is a major issue during its lifetime, especially for the electrolyte layer. Damage of the cells is mainly due to the high operating temperature, the "redox" behaviour of the anode and the brittleness of the involved materials. Since residual stresses are known to play a significant role in the damage evolution, it is important to determine them. For this purpose, residual stresses in an anode-supported planar SOFC were measured by X-ray diffraction. Firstly, macroscopic stresses in each phase of each layer were studied using the sin2ψ method on a laboratory X-ray goniometer at room temperature. This technique enables the calculation of residual stress of the material from the measurement of the crystal lattice deformation. The electrolyte has been found under bi-axial compressive stress of -920 MPa. Secondly, X-ray measurements controlling depth penetration were made in the electrolyte using grazing incidence method. The results show that the stress is not homogenous in the layer. The first five micrometers of the electrolyte have been found less constrained (-750 MPa) than the complete layer, suggesting a gradient of deformation in the electrolyte from the interface with the Anode Functional Layer to the free surface. Finally, local stress measurements were made on the electrolyte layer by X-ray synchrotron radiation that allows high accuracy measurement on the (sub-) micrometer scale. Polychromatic and monochromatic beams are used to determine the complete strain tensor from grain to grain in the electrolyte. First results confirm the macroscopic stress trend of the electrolyte. These X-ray techniques at different scales will contribute to a better understanding of the residual stress in the electrolyte layer and thus to the involved damage mechanisms. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract: Durability is the most pressing issue preventing the efficient commercialization of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) stationary and transportation applications. A big barrier to overcoming the durability limitations is gaining a better understanding of failure modes for user profiles. In addition, durability test protocols for determining the lifetime of PEMFCs are important factors in the development of the technology. These methods are designed to gather enough data about the cell/stack to understand its efficiency and durability without causing it to fail. They also provide some indication of the cell/stack's age in terms of changes in performance over time. Based on a study of the literature, the fundamental factors influencing PEMFC long-term durability and the durability test protocols for both PEMFC stationary and transportation applications were discussed and outlined in depth in this review. This brief analysis should provide engineers and researchers with a fast overview as well as a useful toolbox for investigating PEMFC durability issues.},
